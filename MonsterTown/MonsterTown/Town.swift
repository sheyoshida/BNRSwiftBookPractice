STRUCTS: 
- A type that groups a set of related chunks of data together in memory.
- Making "Town" a struct encapsulates its data within a single type.
- Placing its definition in its own file, provides a convenient locatin to find its implementation.
- Variables contained in a struct are called "Properties". They can be variable or constant.
